# Smart Schedule
This repository documents my learning journey from high-level C++ to low-level systems programming, with the ultimate goal of writing an OS kernel.

What began as a simple C++ class exercise has evolved into a testing ground for understanding the fundamental concepts required for systems programming: manual memory management, pointers, and the transition from object-oriented to procedural and low-level code

Project Goals & Learning Path

This project follows a deliberate, step-by-step learning path:

    1. Learn OOP Principles: Implement a well-structured application in modern C++.

    2. Understand the Machine: Rewrite the same logic in pure C to learn about memory, pointers, and hardware abstraction.

    3. Build Foundations for an OS Kernel: Use this knowledge as a stepping stone towards understanding bootloaders, interrupts, and kernel development.
